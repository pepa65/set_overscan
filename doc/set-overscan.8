.SH NAME
set-overscan \- modify overscan on the fly
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Old TV sets had a significant variation in the size of the picture they
produced; some had cabinets that overlapped the screen. TV pictures were
therefore given a black border so that none of the picture was lost; this
is called overscan. Modern TVs and monitors don't need the border, and the
signal doesn't allow for it. If the initial text shown on the screen
disappears off the edge, you need to ajust overscan to bring the border back.
.PP
This script allows to ajust overscan without rebooting. The script first sets
the new values on the display using the provided \fIoverscan\fR command, then
writes the values to \fI/boot/config.txt\fR
