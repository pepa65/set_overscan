.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Old TV sets had a significant variation in the size of the picture they
produced; some had cabinets that overlapped the screen. TV pictures were
therefore given a black border so that none of the picture was lost; this
is called overscan. Modern TVs and monitors don't need the border, and the
signal doesn't allow for it. If the initial text shown on the screen
disappears off the edge, you need to ajust overscan to bring the border back.
.PP
This script allows to ajust overscan without rebooting. The script sets the
new values on the display for the current session. You still need to set these
in \fI/boot/config.txt\fR if you want to keep them. You can use the provided
command \fIset-overscan\fR to adjust and save those values.
.PP
If the script is executed without any arguments, it will give you the current
configuration from \fBTOP\fR to \fBBOTTOM\fR, followed by \fBLEFT\fR to \fBRIGHT\fR.
.PP
To set new values, you must set all values in the following order:
\fBTOP\fR, \fBBOTTOM\fR, \fBLEFT\fR, \fBRIGHT\fR.
You can't set just one value.
